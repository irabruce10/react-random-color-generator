# React Random Color Generator

### Design and develop a random color generator web application using React. This application will show a random color when a button is clicked:

- A button with the exact text `Generate` will cause a new color to be generated when it is clicked
- Once a color is generated, update the background color of a div which contains the exact text `Generated Color: <background color hex code>` (the background color and the hex code must match)

# ToDo:

- [x] Searching for a library that generates the color
- [x] Save the generates color in the variable
- [x] Create a button which will generate a random color when clicked
- [x] Create a div where the color will display when the button is clicked
- [x] Add a text in the div which will write the name of the actual color

## Stretch Goals

- [x] Ask for a hue
- [x] Ask for a lightness
- [ ] Transition smoothly between the colors as they change
- [x] Use a CSS-in-JS library for all styling (eg. Emotion or Styled Components)
- [ ] Ask for a size for the color box and generate a box of that size
- [ ] Make a "screensaver mode" where the color box moves around in a diagonal pattern, bouncing off the screen edges and changing color (eg. like this)
